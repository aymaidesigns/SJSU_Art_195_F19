# Exhibition Proposal


My piece for this exhibition will be one projection mapping installation, pushing the viewers’ perception of depth and space around them. The installation is composed of 5 upright panels equally staggered on each side of the gallery. Coinciding with the soundscape I will produce, pulsating lights and textures will illuminate the panels at various rhythms. They will alternate between slow and meditative, to fast and erratic. Both sound and visuals will continue on seamless 3.5 minute loop. The idea for this piece was inspired by an audiovisual performance by Second Woman + Pfadfinderei at Gray Area Theater in San Francisco, along with Carsten Nicolai's piece, [α (alpha) pulse](https://vimeo.com/105547177).
